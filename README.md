# Optimizing Citibike's Rebalancing Operations

## Project Overview

This project addresses operational challenges in Citibike's bike-sharing system, particularly focusing on rebalancing operations to reduce station stock-outs during peak hours. The goal is achieving the required 4% efficiency improvement critical for profitability.

## Objectives

- Optimize the distribution of bikes across Citibike stations.
- Minimize operational costs and bike shortages.
- Maximize revenue through strategic bike reallocation and fleet management.

## Methodology

A comprehensive, multi-stage optimization approach was applied:

1. **Basic Rebalancing Model:**

   - Optimized bike movements between 689 stations.
   - Reduced empty station occurrences by 35%.
   - Achieved a net revenue of $71,314.

2. **Replenishment-Enhanced Model:**

   - Included bike return considerations during peak hours.
   - Increased net revenue by 15% to $82,000.

3. **Vehicle Fleet Optimization:**
   - Utilized mixed vehicle fleets (small-capacity vehicles at $0.5/km, large-capacity vehicles at $1/km).
   - Achieved net revenue of $78,500, reducing operational costs by 20%.

## Key Insights

- Significant spatial mismatches exist between supply and demand, particularly in Manhattanâ€™s business district.
- Vehicle fleet management optimization significantly impacts operational efficiency and cost reduction.
- Strategic expansion of docking stations based on spatial analysis further enhances system efficiency.

## Recommendations

### Short-term (0-6 months):

- Deploy basic rebalancing optimization in high-impact areas.
- Implement real-time inventory tracking.
- Initiate mixed vehicle fleet strategy.

### Long-term (6-18 months):

- Integrate predictive demand modeling.
- Develop dynamic pricing strategies.
- Optimize station capacities based on demand patterns.

## Implementation Considerations

- Technical infrastructure (real-time monitoring, system integration).
- Operational training and protocol adjustments.
- Enhanced data collection methods to capture unmet demand.
- Consideration of external factors like weather and operational expenses.

## Projected Outcomes

- Initial investment: approximately $100,000.
- First-year projected net benefits: $250,000-$300,000.
- ROI: 150%-200%.
- Improved customer satisfaction and retention through enhanced service reliability.
